## Projects
### Quantitative Portfolio Management Backtesting Engine
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/YassinKhanji/Portfolio_1)

Developed a structured framework for Universe Selection, Backtesting, and Paper Trading using Market Structure Analysis, Quantitative/Technical Analysis, and Monte Carlo Simulations for stress testing using **Python**. Built modular systems for adaptability, integrating APIs for OHLCV data retrieval and automated trading, while optimizing performance via Bootstrapping and Walk-Forward Optimization (WFO).

### Regime Detection Model for Abnormal Market Conditions

Implemented a research paper for detecting regime change of trading instruments and applied it to the crypto market using **Python**. Used Directional Change Analysis (DCA) to derive features as input for a Hidden Markov Model, and predicted extreme events using Naïve Bayes Classifier. The model successfully identified market regime shifts with high accuracy.
